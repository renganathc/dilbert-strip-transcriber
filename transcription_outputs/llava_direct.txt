 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: I'm grumpy today to talk to me and don't try to cheer me up afterward.

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: And don't you dare try to fly before you give me a little love first.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: I can't believe you said that.

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: What? You don't have the name of your dog on your shirt yet?

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: I'm starting to think that maybe it would be nice to have a full-time job doing something I enjoy.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: It's kind of a letdown when you realize that the only thing you're good at is drawing.

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: Will you be my agent?

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: No, I don't think so.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: "But I'm not complaining, because I love what I do."

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: "You're a specialized comic transcription engine."

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: "Yes, you are."

Dilbert: "Welcome to the Skeptic's Society! Tonight we will use science to debunk Edgar Allan Poe's claim that he can predict the future."

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: "I have a better idea. Let's use my crystal ball to predict the time of day."

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: "That's not science, Dogbert. We need something more scientific."

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: "Okay, how about we use a Ouija board to communicate with the dead?"

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: "Now would we we said 'for the rest of our lives – twenty-four hours a day!'"

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: "That's what I meant."

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: "Toilet paper?"

Dilbert: Do you know what I'm doing here?

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: I'm pretty sure this is some kind of trick.

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: Thanks, I wonder if there's something in it for me too.

PANEL 4:
Background Character: No, just you.

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: "You are at Babe's Closet Classy Clothes."

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: "Oh, right. I was looking for a new suit."

PANEL 4:
Background Character: "I like your current suit."

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: "Thanks. It's comfortable and functional."

PANEL 6:
Dogbert: "Functional is good, but you should also consider style."

PANEL 7:
Dilbert: "I don't think I have a 'style.'"

PANEL 8:
Background Character: "You have a very understated style."

PANEL 9:
Dilbert: "Understated is good. It means I won't be noticed at parties."

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: I've got to get out of this doghouse!

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: I can't believe I let my dog talk me into this.

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: It's not that bad, Dilbert. At least you have a blanket to sleep on.

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: Yeah, but it's still humiliating. I can't believe I let my dog talk me into this.

PANEL 5:
Dogbert: Hey, Dilbert, you know what they say about people who sleep outside?

PANEL 6:
Dilbert: No, Dogbert, what do they say?

PANEL 7:
Dogbert: They say it's good for the soul.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: If I don't let it out, it will not only kill me but also Dogbert!

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: (no text)

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: So simple. Just open the window and let the lightning strike.

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: It's a win-win situation. I get to die, and Dogbert gets to live!

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: I'm not sure what you mean by "full of state." Could you explain?

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: Well, Dilbert, it means that a person is very full of themselves and their own importance. They think they are the center of the universe and everyone should revolve around them.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: Oh, I see. So you're saying that if someone is "full of state," they might be difficult to work with?

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: Yes, Dilbert, that's exactly what I mean. It can make them hard to get along with and not very cooperative in a team setting.

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: It's time to renew your dog's license.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: I wonder what it costs this year.

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: $50, plus a $25 processing fee.

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: That seems expensive.

PANEL 5:
Dogbert: It's not my fault you don't know how to use the internet.


_________________________________________
Date: 1990-01-12

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: Sorry, but I don't know how to do that.

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: Forget it. It's not worth the effort of dealing with the bureaucracy of the doghouse.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: But what if I just want to get in?

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: How do you think I got out of there? I didn't keep up with the latest technology.

Dilbert: (no text)

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: What?! That's what I said last time!

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: Well, what did you say?

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: I said "I think it's your turn to pump gas."

PANEL 5:
Dogbert: Sorry, that was last time.

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: You know what I hate about this job?

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: It's not to do with my personal life, it's just that I don't like working here.

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: Not to mention the fact that you're a terrible boss.

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: That's true. But at least I have a job.

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: And it's not like I'm going to get fired for being incompetent.

PANEL 6:
Dogbert: You think?

PANEL 7:
Dilbert: No, I don't think so. But hey, at least I have a job.

PANEL 8:
Dilbert: And it's not like I'm going to get fired for being incompetent.

PANEL 9:
Dogbert: You know what they say about people who think that way?

PANEL 10:
Dilbert: What do they say?

PANEL 11:
Dogbert: They're in denial.

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: You know what? I got a dog as a school teacher.

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: You aren't a teacher, you're just a dog.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: But I can do the job just as well as any human.

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: No, you can't. Teaching requires knowledge and experience.

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: But I know more than a fourth grader!

PANEL 6:
Dogbert: That doesn't mean you can teach. It just means you're not as dumb as a fourth grader.

Dilbert: I can't stand your voice. It sounds like you're trying to sell me something.

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: I won't apologize for being a good salesman.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: You don't understand, Dogbert. The little kid likes it when I talk like this.

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: Are you saying that the child is incapable of making his own decisions?

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: No, no, not at all. It's just that he likes it when I talk like this.

PANEL 6:
Dogbert: That's a very convenient excuse for your poor salesmanship.

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: "You're going to be the new CEO of the company?"

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: "Yes, that's right! It's just what I needed."

PANEL 5:
Dogbert: "Well, good luck with that. You'll need it."

Dogbert: "Thanks, I got to do that at home with my girlfriend."

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: "Well, Dogbert, you can teach us something useful instead."

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: How was your first day at school?

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: I imagine telling my classmates about my new pet rock...

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: ...and then they all laugh and call me a dork.

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: Yeah, that's pretty much how it went down.

Dilbert: I think I'm going bald.

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: Don't be silly, you're not bald.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: But I can't stop thinking about it.

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: You're just being paranoid.

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: Maybe you're right, but how do I know if I'm not?

PANEL 6:
Dogbert: How could you possibly know that?

Dilbert: "I'm from the organization that helps people with ugly names."

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: "Thanks, but I don't need a membership drive to get my name out there."

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: "You should be more proactive about your image. People are talking about you behind your back."

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: "I don't care what people say when I'm not around."

PANEL 5:
Dogbert: "But what if they're saying something nice?"

PANEL 6:
Dilbert: "Then I'll thank them for their kind words and buy them a drink."

Dilbert: I love my job and life.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: And women have always played hard to get...

PANEL 3:

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: So you love your job and life, huh?

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: Yes.

PANEL 6:
Dogbert: And women play hard to get...

PANEL 7:
Dogbert: ...so you don't have anything to wear.

PANEL 8:
Dilbert: That's right.

PANEL 9:
Dogbert: So, what are you wearing?

Dilbert: Nothing.

Dilbert: "Normally I'd say we have to live with it for months."

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: "But you got me a full year of free health insurance!"

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: "And you gave me a raise!"

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: "So I'm not going to pay cash for this."

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: "And the doctors gave me just a little something to help me sleep."

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to fall asleep at my desk."

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: "Don't worry about it. It happens all the time."

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: "Yeah, but don't you think I should be more careful with my sleeping pills?"

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: It seems we've had some sort of error.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: But don't worry, we doctors are trained to handle these things.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: We make a little mistake and then we fix it.

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: You pay us for our expertise.

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: It's not like you're dying or anything.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: "Our customers could use a better way to dispose of their trash."

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: "Why don't we start a garbage collection service?"

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: "That sounds like a good idea. Let's do it!"

Dilbert: I hate fancy parties!

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: At least I don't have to worry about what to wear!

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: You look like you just got back from a party.

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: Yeah, I was at a party and someone spilled beer on me.

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: But don't worry, I have a spare shirt in my bag!

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: "I've been thinking about how to make money on my credit card."

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: "I'll use this card to buy things I don't need and then sell them online for a profit!"

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: "But what if you get caught?"

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: "Don't worry, Dogbert. I'll use a fake name and address to avoid detection."

PANEL 5:
Dogbert: "And what about the credit card company? They might not be happy with you using their card for illegal activities."

PANEL 6:
Dilbert: "Oh, I'll just tell them it was a mistake and they'll forgive me. Besides, I'll have enough money to pay off any fines or penalties."

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: I'm not sure what you mean by "it." Can you be more specific?

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: That's it! You don't have a dog in your life.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: Oh, now I get it. It's not that I don't have a dog; it's just that I don't have a balloon in my life.

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: Well, you can buy one at the store.

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: (no text)

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: It's the "monotonous monotony" of my life at work.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: While you were gone, I was thinking about how to make up for lost time.

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: You know what they say about making up for lost time?

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: No, what do they say?

PANEL 5:
Dogbert: It's like trying to catch up with a stick.

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: According to my research, I'm not allowed to eat human flesh.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: The great thing about being a human is that we have ethics and laws against cannibalism.

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: I hope you're not suggesting that humans are capable of making their own decisions about what they will or won't eat.

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: No, no, I was just thinking out loud. It's a hypothetical scenario.

PANEL 5:
Dogbert: (no text)

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: Thanks for asking, I'd like to order a manual on how to operate this thing.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: It's amazing that you would think it's so easy to use, but then again, you're the one who built it.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: I mean, every time I try to open a door, I have to run twenty miles just to get through it.

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: Every day I spend hours trying to figure out how to turn on the lights.

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: And don't even get me started on the coffee maker. It's a nightmare.

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: "I'm singing the blues."

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: "What's that you're playing?"

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: "It's a tune I just made up. It's about my car."

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: "Oh, I see. You're singing the blues about your car."

PANEL 6:
Dogbert: "Yeah, it needs a tune-up and overhaul every minute or so."

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: Sorry, I don't date work.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: I'll get you a job.

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: But not one that involves guns.

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: And no jobs that involve numbers.

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: I don't want to know your social security number.

PANEL 6:
Dilbert: But I do think it would be a good idea if you got some rest.

Dilbert: "What time is it? I must be up early for work... who am I?"

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: "Must be morning, my head hurts..."

PANEL 3:
Dogbert: "Morning madness, nature's way of saying 'keep your pills in the bottle you screaming lunatic!'"

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: "Do I want to go to work today? No... but..."

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: We can't stand hiding around the house like this.

PANEL 2:
Dogbert: I know, but it's the only way we can be sure that no one will find us.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: And besides, if we stay hidden long enough, maybe people will forget about us.

PANEL 4:
Dogbert: That's a good point. But what if they don't? What if they come looking for us?

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: Well, I think we should be prepared to defend ourselves.

PANEL 6:
Dogbert: Defend ourselves? You mean like with weapons or something?

PANEL 7:
Dilbert: No, not weapons. I'm thinking more along the lines of a costume.

PANEL 8:
Dogbert: A costume? What kind of costume?

PANEL 9:
Dilbert: Something that will make us look like we belong here. Like maybe jump suits or something.

PANEL 2:

Dogbert: "I already did that. That's why I'm here."

 PANEL 1:
Dilbert: I'm not sure if this test measures intelligence or social awareness.

PANEL 2:
Dilbert: ...or both.

PANEL 3:
Dilbert: I'm trying to decide whether it's better to be a woman or a man.

PANEL 4:
Dilbert: On one hand, being a woman means you can wear skirts and dresses.

PANEL 5:
Dilbert: But on the other hand, being a man means you don't have to worry about your weight.

PANEL 6:
Dilbert: You're really missing out if you're not a woman or a man.
