# Dilbert Strip Transcriber
Work-in-progress project to transcribe Dilbert comic strips using local models...

Current progress:
- Collected strips from Internet Archive (1989–2023)
- Implemented whitespace based panel splitting using OpenCV
- Passed compressed images through a Vision Language Model and extracted transcribed outputs

## Examples

Next steps:
- Compare accuracy figures for different models and make a tabular analysis.
